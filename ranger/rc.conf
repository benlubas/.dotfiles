# ===================================================================
# This file contains the default startup commands for ranger.
# To change them, it is recommended to create either /etc/ranger/rc.conf
# (system-wide) or ~/.config/ranger/rc.conf (per user) and add your custom
# commands there.
#
# If you copy this whole file there, you may want to set the environment
# variable RANGER_LOAD_DEFAULT_RC to FALSE to avoid loading it twice.
#
# The purpose of this file is mainly to define keybindings and settings.
# For running more complex python code, please create a plugin in "plugins/" or
# a command in "commands.py".
#
# Each line is a command that will be run before the user interface
# is initialized.  As a result, you can not use commands which rely
# on the UI such as :delete or :mark.
